# PWM-Drawer-Oscilloscope-_Project-
<br>programming language used: C
<br>software used: Microship Studio, Proteus
<br> this project aims to creats an oscilloscope that captures PWM form and displays frequency, time, and Duty Cycle using an ATmega32 microcontroller and a Graphical LCD (GLCD)
<br> this project was made as the final project of Embedded Systems Diploma held by AMIT
<br> project description is shown in "PWM Drawer.pdf"
<br> code files are in "PWM Drawer" folder
<br> proteus simulation file is in "Proteus Simulation PWM Drawer" folder
<br> used datasheets are in "Resources" folder with highlighted used parts
<br> wiring schematic is present in "Proteus Schematic.PNG"
